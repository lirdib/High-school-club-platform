Welcome to Harry Fultz Club Platform This is the official club section of the Harry Fultz Insititu High School web page. This project was concepted as showroom of projects done by students as part of different clubs on our high school. This intereactive platform allows each student to find his projects fullly detailed. The page is the perfect showroom opportunity for outsiders to see what different clubs do and to go inside each project on details. This platform can very well serve students for job applications in which they can use our platfrom to show their work to the employer. Apart from being an exposit this platfrom is intended to be dynacim which allows users to communincated with the administrating staff by leaving reviews for different projects of different clubs and also giving their opinion by a dedicated feedback page. We have also added a separate page in the name of events to show a slideshow and information of events that have happened or are going to happen in school. Club platform has been fully developed by a group of students led by a few teachers. Inside this group there were programmers and graphic designers who worked in close relation to make this platfrom possible. We hope this page serves to the futur generations of the school.
